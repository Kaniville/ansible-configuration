## ðŸš€ Installation

> â›” **Important variables are present in the `ansible/group_vars` directory. You need to edit them to customize your installation.**

Firstly, install Ansible:
```
# dnf install ansible
```

You can then clone this repository and enter it:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/steadywool/ansible-dotfiles
$ cd ansible-dotfiles
```

Start the playbook and configure your system with this command:
```
$ ansible-playbook ansible/playbook.yml -K
```

> â›” **If you run the entire playbook, or the "user" part with the `root` user, your user configuration will be installed under the root account.**

## ðŸ“• Exemples
